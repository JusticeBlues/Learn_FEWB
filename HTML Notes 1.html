            Note to reader: the ampersand symbol followed by lt or gt and a semicolon creates the angle brackets visible on the webpage that do not trigger element tags. (i.e &lt; &gt;) using the actual symbols in a text editor software will instead trigger an element tag and it will not be visible in a browser.

                    Hyperlinks can be created by using the tag &lt;a href="Qualified URL"&gt;"Hyperlink clickable text"&lt;/a&gt;<br>
                    you can also put "(spacebar)target=_blank" after the quoted Qualified URL to make the linked resource open in a new tab.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Images can be inserted by using the tag &lt;img src="Qualified Image URL" alt="Description of Image (i.e: dog photo)"&gt; there is no closing tag.<br>
                    If the image you want to use is stored locally in the same directory as the HTML file you can use a relative URL like "Dog.jpg" rather than a qualified URL which is beneficial if you are uploading or sending the HTML file with the image file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Relative links can be used for anchor hypertext references too so as long as the connected linked resource is in the same directory as the HTML document.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For placeholder images use the qualified URLs from placebear or placekitten (i.e: https://placebear.com/200/300 you can change the 200 and 300 for any width or height respectively)
                </li>
