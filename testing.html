            This page is a collection of my awesome notes about HTML!

            <h2>The Web</h2>
            The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents and other files. Most of the documents are made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).

            <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
            HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's used to define the structure or layout of a web page.

                This is a qualified link to Justice's favorite stream
                <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1215796444" target="_blank">My best Twitch stream</a>
                <br>it does not need to be in the same directory because it has a full filepath of "https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1215796444" the URL is unclickable because no &lt;a&gt; (anchor tag) was used
            </p>
            To contrast his is an example of relative link <img src="dog.jpg" alt="A dog"><br>if you remove dog.jpg from the same directory as the testing.html file the image will not be found or displayed.
